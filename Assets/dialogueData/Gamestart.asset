  - A young man got out of the car looking at a letter in his hand, before walking
    up a gravel path to the front door of a victorian five story mansion.
  - 'Jaxon:

    "My eccentric Great-Uncle Alfonz has left this place in his will.

    He
    told me I have to come and stay the night as well as answer a series of quizzes
    so I can claim this high tech ancient looking mansion..."'
  - 'Jaxon:

    "If I knew Great-Uncle Alfonz like I did, this deals with his ''A
    Very Inteligent Security System'' I hope the quizzes won''t be hard to beat"'
  - Jaxon, after spending the night went to the front door, and grabbed the doorhandle,
    only to find that it was locked. He then heard a computerized voice say

    You must select the correct answer to these next four questions."'
